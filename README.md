Hi!

There are 2 versions of this silly thing. The [boring]
(https://github.com/jli/hops-to/tree/master/hops-to_local) CLI one and
the [way cooler]
(https://github.com/jli/hops-to/tree/master/hops-to_web) web
version. Just a [ClojureScript]
(https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) and web programming
learning experience, plz ignore.
